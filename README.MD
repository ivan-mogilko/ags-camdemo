Real game art is temporarily replaced with placeholders until I come to terms with original artist. After that I either publish real game art under same or different license, or provide more suitable "programmers art".

**Contributing:** currently I do not accept direct code contributions other than bug fixes, but I may keep your ideas for later consideration.
